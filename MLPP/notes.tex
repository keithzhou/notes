\section{Ch3 Generative Models for Discrete Data}
We have observed a sequence of data. We have a set of hypothesis function to choose from. Which one should we pick?

\subsection{idea: choose the hypothesis that maximizes the probability of seeing the data (MLE)}
\[
h^{\mbox{ mle }} = \arg\max_h p(D|h)
\]

\subsubsection{size principle}
Data: $D=\{2,4\}$. Hypothesis:
\begin{description}
\item[h1] Data is uniformly sampled from ${1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}$
\item[h2] Data is uniformly sampled from ${2,4,6,8,10}$
\end{description}

size principle says $h2$ is more likely because it comes from a smaller sized hypothesis. MLE satisfies size principle.

suppose we have another hypotheses $h3$ that assumes data is uniformly sampled from set ${2,4}$. Now this hypothesis also satisfies the data observed, but it seems too contrived. \emph{Prior} provides a way to encode background knowledge on liklihood of different hypothesis

\subsection{prior}
Prior is a way to encode our belief on liklihood on different hypothesises. It is a mechanism by which background knowledge can be brought to bear on a problem. It is specified by providing $p(h)$

\subsection{posterior}
Posterior is the updated belif on distribution of hypothesis space after the data is observed.
\[
p(h|D) \propto p(D|h)p(h)
\]

Posterior combines original belief(i.e prior) with the evidence from data.

As more data is gathered, liklihood will overwhelm prior and posterior distribution converges to that of liklihood:
\[
\log(p(h|D)) \propto \log{p(h)} + \log p(D|h) \propto \log p(h) + \sum_{n=1}^N\log p(x^{\{n\}}|h)
\]
The second term will overwhelm the first as more data is observed

\subsection{Maximum a posterior estimation (MAP)}
Now we have the posterior distribution on hypothesis space, one approach is to use the MAP estimator as the fianl hypothesis:
\[
h^{\mbox{ map }} = \arg\max_h p(h|D)
\]

\subsection{Posterior predictive distribution}
both MLE and MAP estimators pick one hypothesis from the hypothesis space and use it as the estimator. A full Bayesian approach is to use all hypothesises with their posterior distribution:
\[
p(x|D) = \int_h p(x,h|D)\,dh = \int_h p(x|h,D)p(h|D)\,dh = \int_h p(x|h)p(h|D)\,dh
\]

This averaging is called \emph{Bayes model averaging}.
\subsubsection{Advantage of Bayes model averaging over MLE and MAP}
when dataset is small, posterior $p(h|D)$ is vague, which makes preidiction from different hypothesis gets combined to infer final result. both MLE and MAP uses only one hypothesis.

As dataset gets bigger, posterior will concentrate on one hypothesis and converge to MAP 

\subsection{The beta-binomial model}
Inferring the probability of coin showing up as head given a sequence of observed coin tosses 

\subsubsection{Hypothesis space}
Suppose $X_i \sim \mathrm{Ber}(\theta)$. By varing $\theta$ you get all models in the hypothesis space

\subsubsection{Liklihood}
Suppose observed data are i.i.d:
\[
p(D|\theta) = \theta^{N_h} (1-\theta)^{N_t},
\]
where $N_h$ is the number of heads and $N_t$ is the number of tails and $N=N_h+N_t$

\subsubsection{Sufficient Statistic}
We $s(D)$ is a sufficient statistic for data $D$ if $p(\theta|D)=p(\theta|s(D))$. It means the posterior dsitribution is the same if you use original data $D$ or the sufficient statistic $s(D)$. It captures all we need to know about $D$ to infer parameters $\theta$

In this example the sufficient statistics are $N_h$ and $N_t$

\subsubsection{Prior}
Assume the prior has a beta distribution:
\[
\theta \sim \mathrm{Beta}(\theta|a,b),
\]
where
\[
\mathrm{Beta}(\theta|a,b) \propto \theta^{a-1}(1-\theta)^{b-1}
\]
where $a,b$ are \emph{hyper-parameters} of the distribution

\subsubsection{Posterior}
\[
p(\theta|D) \propto p(D|\theta)p(\theta) = \theta^{N_h+a-1}(1-\theta)^{N_t+b-1} = \mathrm{Beta}(\theta|N_h+a,N_t+b)
\]
Note:
\begin{itemize}
\item That posterior distribution has the same form as the prior distribution. In this case the prior is called the \emph{conjugate prior}
\item the prior is effectively adding psedu conts into the experiment.
\item If you have two datasets $D_a,D_b$, then batch update and sequential update will produce the same posterior. This makes bayesian inference well suited for online learning
\subitem batch update: $p(\theta|D_a,D_b) \propto \mathrm{Beta}(\theta|N_h+a,N_t+a)$
\subitem sequential update: $p(\theta|D_a,D_b) \propto p(\theta,D_a,D_b) \propto p(\theta|D_a)p(D_b|\theta)$
\subitem MAP is outputting the mode of posterior distribution: $\theta^{\mbox{ MAP }} = \frac{N_h+a-1}{N_h+N_t+a+b-2}$
\item the mean of the posterior distribution is $\bar{\theta} = \frac{N_h+a}{N_h+N_t+a+b}$. It is different from the mode of the distribution.
\item posterior variance is $\mathrm{var}(\theta|D) = \frac{(a+N_h)(b+N_t)}{(a+b+N_h+N_t)^2(a+b+N_h+N_t+1)} = \frac{\hat\theta(1- \hat\theta)}{N},$ where $\hat\theta$ is the MLE of $\theta$. 
\subitem the uncertainty $\sigma$ goes down at $\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}}$
\subitem uncertainty is maximum at $\hat\theta = 0.5$, which means for the same dataset its easier to estimate biased coin than unbiased coin, or larger dataset is required to estimate unbiased coin
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Posterior predictive distribution}
\[
p(x=h|D) = \int_\theta p(x=h,\theta|D)\,d\theta = \int_\theta \theta p(\theta|D)\,d\theta = E[\theta|D] = \frac{N_h+a}{N_h+N_t+a+b}
\]
